**What I did**
- Cleaned data, removed duplicates (Order ID + Product Name)
- Fixed dates & numbers, handled blanks
- Added helper columns: Year, Month, Profit Margin, Ship Days
- Built PivotTables + charts (Sales by Year, Profit by Category, Top-10 Products, Avg Ship Days by Region)

**Files**
- `Superstore_Analysis.xlsx` — cleaned data + pivots/charts
- `screenshots/` — images of charts/dashboard
