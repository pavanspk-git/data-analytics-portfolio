## 🏥 Healthcare: Predicting 30-Day Readmission

**Goal:** Predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.  
**Data:** Synthetic (N=500) with demographics, prior admissions, days in hospital, and comorbidities (no PHI).  
**Pipeline:** Collect → Clean → Explore → Visualize → Model → Evaluate → Interpret.

### Files
- `Healthcare_Readmission.ipynb` — Full notebook (Colab/local)
- `patients_readmission_synthetic.csv` — Generated by the notebook


### Insights
- More **prior admissions** → higher readmission risk.
- **Diabetes** and **heart disease** increase risk.
- **Longer stays** correlate with higher readmission likelihood.
